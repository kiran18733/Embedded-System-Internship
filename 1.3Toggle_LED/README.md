# Task 1.3 – Toggle LED Using Push Button

## Objective
To toggle the state of an LED each time a push button is pressed.

## Components Required
- Arduino UNO
- Push button
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- 10kΩ resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Description
In this experiment, the LED changes its state (ON to OFF or OFF to ON)
each time the push button is pressed. Button press detection is implemented
using edge detection to avoid multiple toggles due to button bounce.

## Output
The LED toggles its state on every button press.
