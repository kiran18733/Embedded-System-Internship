# Task 1.10 – IR Based Security System with Reset

## Objective
To design a security system using an IR sensor where an LED keeps blinking
once an object is detected and stops only when a reset button is pressed.

## Description
In this experiment, the IR sensor acts as a security trigger. When an object
is detected, the system enters an alert state and the LED starts blinking
continuously. The alert state remains active even after the object is removed.
The system is reset only when the reset button is pressed.

## Output
The LED blinks continuously after object detection and stops only when the
reset button is pressed.
