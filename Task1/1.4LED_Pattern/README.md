# Task 1.4 – LED Pattern

## Objective
To create a running LED pattern where LEDs glow sequentially from left to right.

In this experiment, multiple LEDs are connected to different digital output pins
of the Arduino. The LEDs are turned ON and OFF sequentially with a fixed delay,
creating a running light pattern.
